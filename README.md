Oh, hello there. I'm...

# Eugene Sillona - Aspiring Front-end Developer.

I am a third-year college student studying Computer Science majoring in Software Technology. I have worked on developing websites for school projects where my major contribution consists of front-end development, website design, and some backend work.

Asides from development, I am also a Music Producer, Graphic Designer, Photographer, and a Video Editor.
